This is my personal emacs configuration, it's derived from purcell's and redguardtoo's.

* Feature
- fully supported computer languages which I use frequency: ~elisp, clojure, coq, racket~.
- organizing configuration with ~use-package~.
- using ~evil~ to have vim-style key bindings.
- *Do not* use package systems in Emacs, most packages are local, and little using ~git~.

* Philosophy
- I hope my configuration can be clean, and so, beautiful.
