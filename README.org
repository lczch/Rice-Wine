This is my personal emacs configuration, it's derived from purcell's and redguardtoo's.

* Feature
- support coq using proof-general and company-coq
- heavily using of company
- using evil to have vim-style key bindings

* Philosophy
- I hope my configuration can be clean, and so, beautiful. 

* Install
- If you want to place this configuration to a specific dir, say "foo/", then 
  you can execute below commands in shell:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd foo
     git clone git@github.com:lczch/rice-wine.git
   #+END_SRC
- override your ~/.emacs:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load-file "foo/rice-wine/init.el")
   #+END_SRC
  
- Becuase I *do* have all the packages (expect a little) in my configuration staticly, 
  so it is enough to work.  
  But I use git version of company-coq and PG.  
  So, git clone them under site-lisp dir.
